# Description

Given an expression, `e`, convert it into an anonymous function over tuples. It
is assumed that `index` defines a mapping from symbols to indices that contains
an entry for every symbol that should be treated as a column name in `e`.

# Arguments

1. `e::Any`: An expression to be converted into an anonymous function
    expression.
2. `tuple_name::Any`: The local name of the tuple that the function will act
    upon. To maximize the readability of the resulting function, pass in a
    readable like `:t`. Use `safe_tuple_name` to find a name that is guaranteed
    to be safe to use.
3. `index::Dict{Symbol, Int}`: A mapping from column name symbosl to indices in
    the input tuple.
4. `passes::NamedTuple`: A specification of which rewrite passes should be
    performed on the input. There are three that can be activated:
    1. `locals`: A pass to unescape locals as in `a + \$b`.
    2. `lift`: A pass to lift all function calls. See docs/lifting.md for more
        details.
    3. `tvl`: A pass to rewrite all uses of `||` and `&&` to use three-valued
        logic.
    Currently `lift` is disabled as the functionality is not yet complete. The
    others are enabled by default, but can be turned off for easier debugging.

# Return Values

1. `eâ€²::Any`: A new expression that defines an anonymous function in tuple
    form. See docs/forms.md for details.

# Examples

```
julia> tuple_form(:(a + b), :t, Dict(:a => 1, :b => 2))
:(t->begin
          #= REPL[21]:55 =#
          ($(Expr(:escape, :+)))(t[1], t[2])
      end)
```
